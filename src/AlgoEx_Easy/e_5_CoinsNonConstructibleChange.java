//We are given an array of positive integers, which represent the values of coins
// that we have in our possession. The array could have duplicates. We are asked
// to write a function that returns the minimum amount of change that we cannot
// create with our coins. For instance, if the input array is [1, 2, 5], the
// minimum amount of change that we cannot create is 4, since we
// can create 1, 2, 3 (1 + 2) and 5.
