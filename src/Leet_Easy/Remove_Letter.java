//2423. Remove Letter To Equalize Frequency
// https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-letter-to-equalize-frequency/

//Example 1:
//
//        Input: word = "abcc"
//        Output: true
//        Explanation: Select index 3 and delete it: word becomes "abc" and each character has a frequency of 1.
//        Example 2:
//
//        Input: word = "aazz"
//        Output: false
//        Explanation: We must delete a character, so either the frequency of "a" is 1 and the frequency of "z" is 2, or vice versa. It is impossible to make all present letters have equal frequency.
